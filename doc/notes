I started writing this code fall of my senior year. Savitch's introduction 
textbook on Java programming was a graet place to start, especially with 
setting up Linked Data structures. 

I picked this up a few months ago, where I added the JUnit tests and the XML
build script with Apache Ant. This made testing scripts both much more clean 
and more flexible, perfect for a medium size software project.  

I imagine that as the scale increases, the XML format will no longer be as 
practical as graphical IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
